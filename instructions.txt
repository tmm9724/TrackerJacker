1. run the included bash script
2. Provide the IP address
3. Wait for the program to give you 3 unique coordinates, then go to
   http://geo.javawa.nl/coordcalc/index_en.html and select 'Intersection point of three
   circles'. Enter the coordinates you got in the bottom left text box/s, and play
   with the radius option to narrow down or widen the search area.

You have now successfully triangulated an approximate location from just an IP address!
